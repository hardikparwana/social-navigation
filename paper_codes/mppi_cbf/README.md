### Demo 2: planar quadrotor
The following animations are simulation result of MPPI controller with CBF cost for obstacle avoidance.
- Left: w/ CBF as a cost term in MPPI.
- Right: w/ CBF as a cost term in MPPI. A suspended payload is attached to the quadrotor.

### Note for implementations
- The terminal cost in MPPI is significant. It enhances the quality of the control sequence's prior, thereby preventing the controller from inadvertently deviating the system from its target position.
- The discrete CBF cost aligns well with sampling-based predictive controllers, introducing only minimal additional computation.
- The guarantees provided by CBF-QP diminish with discretization.
